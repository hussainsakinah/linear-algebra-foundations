# Linear Algebra Foundations

This repository showcases my foundational understanding of Linear Algebra concepts implemented from scratch using Python.

It focuses on the mathematical building blocks that power Machine Learning, Data Science, AI systems and Quantum Computers.

## Topics Covered

• Vector operations  
• Matrix addition & subtraction  
• Matrix multiplication  
• Transpose of a matrix  
• Determinants  
• Eigenvalues & eigenvectors (basic computation)

## Objective

To bridge mathematical theory with computational implementation and strengthen algorithmic understanding of linear algebraic systems.

## Tools Used

Python, NumPy (minimal usage)

## Future Additions

• Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
• Principal Component Analysis (PCA math)  
• Linear transformations visualization
